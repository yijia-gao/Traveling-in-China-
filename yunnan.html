      Introduce Yunnan
    </h2>
    <p1>
      Yunnan is a province of the People's Republic of China, located in the far southwest of the country. It spans approximate
    ly 394,000 square kilometres (152,000 sq mi) and has a population of 45.7 million (as of 2009). The capital of the province 
    is Kunming, formerly also known as Yunnan. The province borders the Chinese provinces Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and the 
    Tibet Autonomous Region, and the countries Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar.
      <br>
      Yunnan is situated in a mountainous area, with high elevations in the northwest and low elevations in the southeast. Most 
    of the population lives in the eastern part of the province. In the west, the altitude can vary from the mountain peaks to 
    river valleys as much as 3,000 metres (9,800 ft). Yunnan is rich in natural resources and has the largest diversity of plant 
    life in China. Of the approximately 30,000 species of higher plants in China, Yunnan has perhaps 17,000 or more.[4] Yunnan's 
    reserves of aluminium, lead, zinc and tin are the largest in China, and there are also major reserves of copper and nickel.

      The Han Empire first recorded diplomatic relations with the province at the end of the 2nd century BC. It became the seat 
    of a Sino-Tibetan-speaking kingdom of Nanzhao in the 8th century AD. Nanzhao was multi-ethnic, but the elite most-likely spoke 
    a northern dialect of Yi. The Mongols conquered the region in the 13th century, with local control exercised by warlords until 
    the 1930s. From the Yuan dynasty onward, the area was part of a central-government sponsored population movement towards the 
    southwestern frontier, with two major waves of migrants arriving from Han-majority areas in northern and southeast China. As 
    with other parts of China's southwest, Japanese occupation in the north during World War II forced another migration of majority 
    Han people into the region. These two waves of migration contributed to Yunnan being one of the most ethnically diverse provinces 
    of China, with ethnic minorities accounting for about 34 percent of its total population. Major ethnic groups include Yi, Bai, Hani, 
    Zhuang, Dai and Miao.

      In ancient times, the Baisha Old Town used to be the center of silk embroidery in the southwest of China and the most important 
    place of the Ancient Southern Silk Road, also called the Ancient Tea and Horse Road or Ancient tea route. The Ancient Southern Silk 
    Road started from Burma, crossed Lijiang, Shangri-La County, Tibet, journeyed through Iran, the Fertile Crescent, and ultimately to 
    the Mediterranean Sea.
