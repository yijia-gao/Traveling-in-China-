        The surrounding Chengdu Plain is also known as the "Country of Heaven", and the "Land of Abundance". Its prehistoric 
     settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. Founded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is 
     unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name (nearly) unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, 
     and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local 
     kingdoms during the Middle Ages.[citation needed]After the fall of Nanjing to the Japanese in 1937, Chengdu briefly served 
     as the capital of China. It is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, 
     and communication centers in Western China. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan 
     Airlines is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and Chengdu Railway Station is one of the six biggest in China. 
     Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates. More than 260 Fortune 500 companies have 
     established branches in Chengdu.

        Consisting of Wide Alley (Kuan Xiangzi), Narrow Alley (Zhai Xiangzi), Well Alley (Jing Xiangzi) three parallel ancient 
     city alleys and 45 courtyards along them, Wide and Narrow Alley is one of Chengdu’s historical and cultural reserves, 
     together with Daci Temple reserve and Wenshu Monastery reserve. It is a microcosm of the city’s history as well as a deep 
     mark in local people’s memory.
        <br>
        The history of Wide and Narrow Alley can be dated back to the Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1911 AD). At that time, the area was 
     a city within the Chengdu city called Mancheng City or Shaocheng City, where the court quartered troops. As time passed by, 
     the city decayed and only the Wide Alley and Narrow Alley were left. In 2003, renovation work of the two alleys began, 
     aiming to build a complex cultural and business street with the functions of tourism and recreation. On June 14, 2008, the 
     newly renovated Wide, Narrow and Well Alley were opened to the public, located in nowadays Qingyang District, to the east of 
     Tongren Road and west of Changshun Street. Nowadays, Wide and Narrow Alley is a popular entertainment and nightlife block as 
     well as a famous tourism site, with lots of restaurants, pubs, teahouses, and stores selling featured souvenirs.

        Delicious Food in Chengdu (That's a lot)
      </h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Mapo Tofu（麻婆豆腐）
      </h3>
      <p1>
        Mapo doufu or Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐) is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan province. It consists of tofu set in a spicy 
     auce, typically a thin, oily, and bright red suspension, based on douban 豆瓣 (fermented broadbean and chili paste) and 
     douchi 豆豉 (fermented black beans), along with minced meat, usually pork or beef. Variations exist with other ingredients 
     such as water chestnuts, onions, other vegetables, or wood ear fungus.
        <br>
        Authentic Mapo doufu is powerfully spicy with both conventional "heat" spiciness and the characteristic "mala" (numbing 
     spiciness) flavor of Sichuan cuisine. The feel of the particular dish is often described by cooks using seven specific 
     Chinese adjectives: 麻 (numbing), 辣 (spicy hot), 烫 (hot temperature), 鲜 (fresh), 嫩 (tender and soft), 香 (aromatic), and 
     酥 (flaky). The authentic form of the dish is increasingly easy to find outside China today, but usually only in Sichuanese 
     restaurants that do not adapt the dish for non-Sichuanese tastes.
        <br>

        <br>
        The most important and necessary ingredients in the dish that give it the distinctive flavour are chili broad bean paste 
     (salty bean paste) from Sichuan's Pixian county (郫县豆瓣酱), fermented black beans, chili oil, chili flakes of the heaven-facing 
     pepper (朝天辣椒), Sichuan peppercorns, garlic, green onions, and rice wine.[2] Supplementary ingredients include water or stock, 
     sugar (depending on the saltiness of the bean paste brand used), and starch (if it is desired to thicken the sauce).

      <h3>
        Dandan Mian(Noodles)（担担面）
      </h3>
      <p1>
        Dandan noodles or dandanmianis a noodle dish originating from Chinese Sichuan cuisine. It consists of a spicy sauce 
     containing preserved vegetables (often including zha cai (榨菜), lower enlarged mustard stems, or ya cai (芽菜), upper 
     mustard stems), chili oil, Sichuan pepper, minced pork, and scallions served over noodles.
        <br>
        Sesame paste and/or peanut butter is sometimes added, and occasionally replaces the spicy sauce, usually in the 
     Taiwanese and American Chinese style of the dish. In this case, dandanmian is considered as a variation of ma jiang mian 
     (麻醬麵), sesame sauce noodles. In American Chinese cuisine, dandanmian is often sweeter, less spicy, and less soupy than its
     Sichuan counterpart.
        <br>
        <img src="https://spicetrekkers.com//upload/recettes/Dandan-Mian.jpg"/>
        The name refers to a type of carrying pole (dan dan) that was used by walking street vendors who sold the dish to passers-by. 
     The pole was carried over the shoulder, with two baskets containing noodles and sauce attached at either end. As the noodles were 
     affordable due to their low cost, the local people gradually came to call them dandan noodles, referencing the street vendors. 
     Literally, the name translates as "noodles carried on a pole", but may be better translated as "peddler's noodles".
        <br>
        A variety of English spellings are used. The first word may be either dandan, dundun or tantan, and the last word may 
     also be spelled mein.
