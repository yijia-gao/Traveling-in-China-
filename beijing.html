    Introduc Beijing
  </h2>
  <p1>
    Beijing, the capital city of China. The world's second most populous city proper, and most populous capital city. The city, located in 
  northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.
  Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the
  three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China.

    As a city combining both modern and traditional architecture, Beijing is a megacity rich in history, exemplified in its global influence 
  in politics, economy, education, history, culture, and technology. Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after 
  Shanghai and is the nation's political, cultural, and educational center. It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest 
  state-owned companies and is a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital 
  International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic since 2010, and, as of 2016, the city's subway 
  network is the busiest and second longest in the world, after Shanghai's subway system.

    The city's history dates back three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center 
  of the country for much of the past eight centuries. With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner 
  and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the 
  imperial capital. Beijing was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium A.D. The city is renowned for its 
  opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates. Its art treasures and universities have made it center of culture and art in 
  China. Encyclopædia Britannica notes that "few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural centre of 
  an area as immense as China." Beijing has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites – the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, 
  Zhoukoudian, as well as parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal, all popular locations for tourism. Siheyuans, the city's traditional housing 
  style, and hutongs, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing. The city hosted the 2008 Summer 
  Olympics and was chosen to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.

    Many of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best in China, of which Peking University and Tsinghua University are ranked in 
  the top 60 universities of the world. In 2015, 52 companies of the Fortune Global 500 company headquarters were located in Beijing, more than any 
  other city in the world, including state-owned enterprises State Grid, China National Petroleum, and Sinopec Group, ranked 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, 
  respectively. Beijing CBD is quickly becoming the center for Beijing's economic expansion, rapid modernization, and radically changing skyline, with 
  the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers. Beijing's Zhongguancun area is also known as China's Silicon Valley and China's 
  center of innovation and technology entrepreneurship. According to the 2016 InterNations Expat Insider Survey, Beijing ranked first in Asia in the 
  subcategory "Personal Finance Index," a measure of expats' salaries versus cost of living in the city. Expats live primarily in urban districts such as 
  Dongcheng and Chaoyang in the east, or in suburban districts such as Shunyi.

    Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, and Gu Gong in Chinese, lies at the city center of Beijing, and once served 
  as the imperial palace for 24 emperors during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368 - 1911). It was first built throughout 14 years 
  during the reign of Emperor Chengzu in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Ancient Chinese Astronomers believed that the Purple Star 
  (Polaris) was in the center of heaven and the Heavenly Emperor lived in the Purple Palace. The Palace for the emperor on earth 
  was so called the Purple City. It was forbidden to enter without special permission of the emperor. Hence its name 'The Purple 
  Forbidden City', usually 'The Forbidden City'.

  complex and covers 74 hectares. Surrounded by a 52-meter-wide moat and a 10-meter-high wall are more than 8,700 rooms. The wall 
  has a gate on each side. The distance between the south Meridian Gate (Wumen) and the north Gate of Divine Prowess (Shenwumen) is 
  961 meters (1,051 yards), while the distance between the east and west gates is 753 meters (823 yards). There are unique and 
  delicately structured towers on each of the four corners of the curtain wall. These afford views over both the palace and the city 
  outside.

  <h4>
    Introdction of The Beijing(Peking) Duck 
  </h4>
  <div>
    <br>
    <p1>
      Peking duck is a dish from Peking that has been prepared since the imperial era. The meat is characterized by its thin, crisp 
    skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook. Ducks 
    bred specially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a closed or hung oven. The meat is 
    eaten with spring onion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce with pancakes rolled around the fillings. Sometimes pickled radish is also 
    inside, and other sauces (like hoisin sauce) can be used.

    <h4>
      The history of the Beijing(Peking) Duck
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p1> 
      Duck has been roasted in China since the Southern and Northern Dynasties. A variation of roast duck was prepared for the Emperor 
    of China in the Yuan Dynasty. The dish, originally named "shāo yāzi" (烧鸭子), was mentioned in the Complete Recipes for Dishes and 
    Beverages (饮膳正要) manual in 1330 by Hu Sihui (忽思慧), an inspector of the imperial kitchen. The Peking Roast Duck that came 
    to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming Dynasty， and by then, Peking Duck was one of the 
    main dishes on imperial court menus. The first restaurant specialising in Peking Duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, 
    close to Qianmen of Beijing in 1416.

      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Dry_for_5_hours_cropped.jpg/800px-Dry_for_5_hours_cropped.jpg"/>   
      <br>
      By the Qianlong Period (1736–1796) of the Qing Dynasty, the popularity of Peking Duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring poetry 
    from poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish. For instance, one verse of Dūmén zhúzhīcí, a Beijing local poem was, "Fill your plates 
    with roast duck and suckling pig".
      <br>
      In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing. Yang Quanren (杨全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the 
    hung oven to roast ducks. With its innovations and efficient management, the restaurant became well known in China, introducing the 
    Peking Duck to the rest of the world.
      <br>

      <br>
      By the mid-20th century, Peking Duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike. For example, 
    Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, 
    during his first (secret) visit to China. After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for 
    lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite. The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard 
    Nixon to visit China in 1972. Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking Duck. Peking 
    Duck, at the Quanjude in particular, has also been a favorite dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro 
    to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.
      <br>
      Two notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become 
    household names, each with their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique 
    of closed oven roasting.
