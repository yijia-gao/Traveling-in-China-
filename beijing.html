    Introduc Beijing
  </h2>
  <p1>
    Beijing, the capital city of China. The world's second most populous city proper, and most populous capital city. The city, located in 
  northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.
  Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the
  three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China.

    As a city combining both modern and traditional architecture, Beijing is a megacity rich in history, exemplified in its global influence 
  in politics, economy, education, history, culture, and technology. Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after 
  Shanghai and is the nation's political, cultural, and educational center. It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest 
  state-owned companies and is a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital 
  International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic since 2010, and, as of 2016, the city's subway 
  network is the busiest and second longest in the world, after Shanghai's subway system.

    The city's history dates back three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center 
  of the country for much of the past eight centuries. With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner 
  and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the 
  imperial capital. Beijing was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium A.D. The city is renowned for its 
  opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates. Its art treasures and universities have made it center of culture and art in 
  China. Encyclopædia Britannica notes that "few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural centre of 
  an area as immense as China." Beijing has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites – the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, 
  Zhoukoudian, as well as parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal, all popular locations for tourism. Siheyuans, the city's traditional housing 
  style, and hutongs, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing. The city hosted the 2008 Summer 
  Olympics and was chosen to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.

    Many of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best in China, of which Peking University and Tsinghua University are ranked in 
  the top 60 universities of the world. In 2015, 52 companies of the Fortune Global 500 company headquarters were located in Beijing, more than any 
  other city in the world, including state-owned enterprises State Grid, China National Petroleum, and Sinopec Group, ranked 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, 
  respectively. Beijing CBD is quickly becoming the center for Beijing's economic expansion, rapid modernization, and radically changing skyline, with 
  the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers. Beijing's Zhongguancun area is also known as China's Silicon Valley and China's 
  center of innovation and technology entrepreneurship. According to the 2016 InterNations Expat Insider Survey, Beijing ranked first in Asia in the 
  subcategory "Personal Finance Index," a measure of expats' salaries versus cost of living in the city. Expats live primarily in urban districts such as 
  Dongcheng and Chaoyang in the east, or in suburban districts such as Shunyi.

  <h3>
    The Forbidden City（紫禁城）（故宫） 
  </h3>

    Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, and Gu Gong in Chinese, lies at the city center of Beijing, and once served 
  as the imperial palace for 24 emperors during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368 - 1911). It was first built throughout 14 years 
  during the reign of Emperor Chengzu in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Ancient Chinese Astronomers believed that the Purple Star 
  (Polaris) was in the center of heaven and the Heavenly Emperor lived in the Purple Palace. The Palace for the emperor on earth 
  was so called the Purple City. It was forbidden to enter without special permission of the emperor. Hence its name 'The Purple 
  Forbidden City', usually 'The Forbidden City'.

    <div>
    <br>
      Now known as the Palace Museum, it is to the north of Tiananmen Square. Rectangular in shape, it is the world's largest palace 
  complex and covers 74 hectares. Surrounded by a 52-meter-wide moat and a 10-meter-high wall are more than 8,700 rooms. The wall 
  has a gate on each side. The distance between the south Meridian Gate (Wumen) and the north Gate of Divine Prowess (Shenwumen) is 
  961 meters (1,051 yards), while the distance between the east and west gates is 753 meters (823 yards). There are unique and 
  delicately structured towers on each of the four corners of the curtain wall. These afford views over both the palace and the city 
  outside.
      <br>
      When Hongwu Emperor's son Zhu Di became the Yongle Emperor, he moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing, and construction began 
  in 1406 on what would become the Forbidden City.

      <br>
      Construction lasted 14 years and required more than a million workers. Material used include whole logs of precious Phoebe zhennan 
  wood (Chinese: 楠木; pinyin: nánmù) found in the jungles of south-western China, and large blocks of marble from quarries near Beijing.
  The floors of major halls were paved with "golden bricks" (Chinese: 金砖; pinyin: jīnzhuān), specially baked paving bricks from Suzhou.
      <br>
      From 1420 to 1644, the Forbidden City was the seat of the Ming dynasty. In April 1644, it was captured by rebel forces led by Li 
  Zicheng, who proclaimed himself emperor of the Shun dynasty. He soon fled before the combined armies of former Ming general Wu Sangui 
  and Manchu forces, setting fire to parts of the Forbidden City in the process.

      By October, the Manchus had achieved supremacy in northern China, and a ceremony was held at the Forbidden City to proclaim the 
  young Shunzhi Emperor as ruler of all China under the Qing dynasty. The Qing rulers changed the names on some of the principal buildings, 
  to emphasise "Harmony" rather than "Supremacy", made the name plates bilingual (Chinese and Manchu), and introduced Shamanist elements 
  to the palace.
      <br>
      In 1860, during the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces took control of the Forbidden City and occupied it until the end of the war.
  In 1900 Empress Dowager Cixi fled from the Forbidden City during the Boxer Rebellion, leaving it to be occupied by forces of the treaty 
  powers until the following year.
      <br>
      After being the home of 24 emperors – 14 of the Ming dynasty and 10 of the Qing dynasty – the Forbidden City ceased being the political 
  centre of China in 1912 with the abdication of Puyi, the last Emperor of China. Under an agreement with the new Republic of China government, 
  Puyi remained in the Inner Court, while the Outer Court was given over to public use, until he was evicted after a coup in 1924. The Palace 
  Museum was then established in the Forbidden City in 1925. In 1933, the Japanese invasion of China forced the evacuation of the national 
  treasures in the Forbidden City. Part of the collection was returned at the end of World War II, but the other part was evacuated to Taiwan 
  in 1948 under orders by Chiang Kai-shek, whose Kuomintang was losing the Chinese Civil War. This relatively small but high quality collection 
  was kept in storage until 1965, when it again became public, as the core of the National Palace Museum in Taipei.

      <br>
      After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, some damage was done to the Forbidden City as the country was swept up 
  in revolutionary zeal. During the Cultural Revolution, however, further destruction was prevented when Premier Zhou Enlai sent an army battalion 
  to guard the city.
      <br>
      The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987 by UNESCO as the "Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties", due to its 
  significant place in the development of Chinese architecture and culture. It is currently administered by the Palace Museum, which is carrying 
  out a sixteen-year restoration project to repair and restore all buildings in the Forbidden City to their pre-1912 state.
      <br>
      n recent years, the presence of commercial enterprises in the Forbidden City has become controversial. A Starbucks store that opened in 2000 
  sparked objections and eventually closed on 13 July 2007. Chinese media also took notice of a pair of souvenir shops that refused to admit 
  Chinese citizens in order to price-gouge foreign customers in 2006.

    Badaling Changcheng(Great Wall)
  </h3>
  <p1>
      Badaling is the site of the most visited section of the Great Wall of China, approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of 
  urban Beijing city in Yanqing District, which is within the Beijing municipality. The portion of the wall running through the 
  site was built in 1504 during the Ming Dynasty, along with a military outpost reflecting the location's strategic importance. 
  The highest point of Badaling is Beibalou (北八楼), approximately 1,015 metres (3,330 ft) above sea level.
    <br>
      Badaling Great Wall was built in the Ming Dynasty (1505) to occupy a commanding and strategic position for protecting the 
  Juyongguan Pass (Juyongguan section of the Great Wall) on its south, further protecting the city of Beijing.

    <br>
      The portion of the wall at Badaling has undergone restoration, and in 1957 it was the first section of the wall to open to 
  tourists. Now visited annually by millions, the immediate area has seen significant development, including hotels, restaurants, 
  and a cable car. The recently completed Badaling Expressway connects Badaling with central Beijing. Line S2, Beijing Suburban 
  Railway, served people who wanted to go to the Great Wall from Beijing North Railway Station. The 877 bus runs frequently between 
  Deshengmen Bus Station (adjacent to the Jishuitan Station on Line 2, Beijing Subway) and Badaling.
      It was here that President Richard Nixon and his wife, accompanied by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, visited on February 24, 1972, 
  during his historic journey to China. Many other world leaders have made a trip to the site including Margaret Thatcher, Ronald 
  Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.

      Peking duck is a dish from Peking that has been prepared since the imperial era. The meat is characterized by its thin, crisp 
    skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook. Ducks 
    bred specially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a closed or hung oven. The meat is 
    eaten with spring onion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce with pancakes rolled around the fillings. Sometimes pickled radish is also 
    inside, and other sauces (like hoisin sauce) can be used.

    <h4>
      The history of the Beijing(Peking) Duck
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p1> 
      Duck has been roasted in China since the Southern and Northern Dynasties. A variation of roast duck was prepared for the Emperor 
    of China in the Yuan Dynasty. The dish, originally named "shāo yāzi" (烧鸭子), was mentioned in the Complete Recipes for Dishes and 
    Beverages (饮膳正要) manual in 1330 by Hu Sihui (忽思慧), an inspector of the imperial kitchen. The Peking Roast Duck that came 
    to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming Dynasty， and by then, Peking Duck was one of the 
    main dishes on imperial court menus. The first restaurant specialising in Peking Duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, 
    close to Qianmen of Beijing in 1416.
      <br>   
      By the Qianlong Period (1736–1796) of the Qing Dynasty, the popularity of Peking Duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring poetry 
    from poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish. For instance, one verse of Dūmén zhúzhīcí, a Beijing local poem was, "Fill your plates 
    with roast duck and suckling pig".
      <br>
      In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing. Yang Quanren (杨全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the 
    hung oven to roast ducks. With its innovations and efficient management, the restaurant became well known in China, introducing the 
    Peking Duck to the rest of the world.
      <br>

      <br>
      By the mid-20th century, Peking Duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike. For example, 
    Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, 
    during his first (secret) visit to China. After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for 
    lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite. The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard 
    Nixon to visit China in 1972. Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking Duck. Peking 
    Duck, at the Quanjude in particular, has also been a favorite dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro 
    to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.
      <br>
      Two notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become 
    household names, each with their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique 
    of closed oven roasting.
