    Beijing, China’s massive capital, has history stretching back 3 millennia. Yet it’s known as much for its modern architecture 
as its ancient sites such as the grand Forbidden City complex, the imperial palace during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Nearby, 
the massive Tiananmen Square pedestrian plaza is the site of Mao Zedong’s mausoleum and the National Museum of China, 
displaying a vast collection of cultural relics.
