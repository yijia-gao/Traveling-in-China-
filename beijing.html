    Introduc Beijing
  </h2>
  <p1>
    Beijing, the capital city of China. The world's second most populous city proper, and most populous capital city. The city, located in 
  northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.
  Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the
  three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China.

    As a city combining both modern and traditional architecture, Beijing is a megacity rich in history, exemplified in its global influence 
  in politics, economy, education, history, culture, and technology. Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after 
  Shanghai and is the nation's political, cultural, and educational center. It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest 
  state-owned companies and is a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital 
  International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic since 2010, and, as of 2016, the city's subway 
  network is the busiest and second longest in the world, after Shanghai's subway system.

    The city's history dates back three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center 
  of the country for much of the past eight centuries. With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner 
  and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the 
  imperial capital. Beijing was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium A.D. The city is renowned for its 
  opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates. Its art treasures and universities have made it center of culture and art in 
  China. Encyclopædia Britannica notes that "few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural centre of 
  an area as immense as China." Beijing has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites – the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, 
  Zhoukoudian, as well as parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal, all popular locations for tourism. Siheyuans, the city's traditional housing 
  style, and hutongs, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing. The city hosted the 2008 Summer 
  Olympics and was chosen to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.

    Many of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best in China, of which Peking University and Tsinghua University are ranked in 
  the top 60 universities of the world. In 2015, 52 companies of the Fortune Global 500 company headquarters were located in Beijing, more than any 
  other city in the world, including state-owned enterprises State Grid, China National Petroleum, and Sinopec Group, ranked 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, 
  respectively. Beijing CBD is quickly becoming the center for Beijing's economic expansion, rapid modernization, and radically changing skyline, with 
  the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers. Beijing's Zhongguancun area is also known as China's Silicon Valley and China's 
  center of innovation and technology entrepreneurship. According to the 2016 InterNations Expat Insider Survey, Beijing ranked first in Asia in the 
  subcategory "Personal Finance Index," a measure of expats' salaries versus cost of living in the city. Expats live primarily in urban districts such as 
  Dongcheng and Chaoyang in the east, or in suburban districts such as Shunyi.

    Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, and Gu Gong in Chinese, lies at the city center of Beijing, and once served 
  as the imperial palace for 24 emperors during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368 - 1911). It was first built throughout 14 years 
  during the reign of Emperor Chengzu in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Ancient Chinese Astronomers believed that the Purple Star 
  (Polaris) was in the center of heaven and the Heavenly Emperor lived in the Purple Palace. The Palace for the emperor on earth 
  was so called the Purple City. It was forbidden to enter without special permission of the emperor. Hence its name 'The Purple 
  Forbidden City', usually 'The Forbidden City'.

    Now known as the Palace Museum, it is to the north of Tiananmen Square. Rectangular in shape, it is the world's largest palace 
  complex and covers 74 hectares. Surrounded by a 52-meter-wide moat and a 10-meter-high wall are more than 8,700 rooms. The wall 
  has a gate on each side. The distance between the south Meridian Gate (Wumen) and the north Gate of Divine Prowess (Shenwumen) is 
  961 meters (1,051 yards), while the distance between the east and west gates is 753 meters (823 yards). There are unique and 
  delicately structured towers on each of the four corners of the curtain wall. These afford views over both the palace and the city 
  outside.
