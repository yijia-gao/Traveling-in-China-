        Introduce Shanghai
      </h2>
      <p1>
        Shanghai is one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of China and the most populous city in the world, with a 
      population of more than 24 million as of 2017. It is a global financial centre and transport hub, with the world's busiest 
      Yangtze in the middle portion of the East China coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to 
      container port. Located in the Yangtze River Delta, it sits on the south edge of the estuary of the the north, south and 
      west, and is bounded to the east by the East China Sea.

        As a major administrative, shipping and trading city, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and 
      recognition of its favourable port location and economic potential. The city was one of five treaty ports forced open to 
      foreign trade following the British victory over China in the First Opium War. The subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 
      1844 Treaty of Whampoa allowed the establishment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. The 
      city then flourished as a centre of commerce between China and other parts of the world (predominantly the Occident), and 
      became the primary financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. However, with the Communist Party takeover of the 
      mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined. In the 1990s, 
      the economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense re-development of the city, aiding the return of 
      finance and foreign investment to the city. It has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the 
      home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of the world's largest by market capitalization.

      <h3>
        Waitan(The Bund/外滩）
      </h3>
      <p1>
        The Bund or Waitan is a waterfront area in central Shanghai. The area centers on a section of Zhongshan Road 
     (East-1 Zhongshan Road) within the former Shanghai International Settlement, which runs along the western bank of the Huangpu 
     River in the eastern part of Huangpu District. The area along the river faces the modern skyscrapers of Lujiazui in the Pudong 
     District. The Bund usually refers to the buildings and wharves on this section of the road, as well as some adjacent areas. It 
     is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Shanghai. Building heights are restricted in the area.
        <br>
        The Shanghai Bund has dozens of historical buildings, lining the Huangpu River, that once housed numerous banks and trading 
     houses from the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Italy, Russia, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and Belgium, as well 
     as the consulates of Russia and Britain, a newspaper, the Shanghai Club and the Masonic Club. The Bund lies north of the old, 
     walled city of Shanghai. It was initially a British settlement; later the British and American settlements were combined in the 
     International Settlement. Magnificent commercial buildings in the Beaux Arts style sprung up in the years around the turn of the 
     20th century as the Bund developed into a major financial center of east Asia. Directly to the south, and just northeast of the 
     old walled city, the former French Bund (the quai de France, part of the Shanghai French Concession) was of comparable size to 
     the Bund but functioned more as a working harbourside.
        <br>

        <br>
        By the 1940s, the Bund housed the headquarters of many, if not most, of the major financial institutions operating in China, 
     including the "big four" national banks in the Republic of China era. However, with the Communist victory in the Chinese civil 
     war, many of the financial institutions were moved out gradually in the 1950s, and the hotels and clubs closed or converted to 
     other uses. The statues of colonial figures and foreign worthies which had dotted the riverside were also removed.
        <br>
        In the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the thawing of economic policy in the People's Republic of China, buildings on the Bund 
     were gradually returned to their former uses. Government institutions were moved out in favour of financial institutions, while 
     hotels resumed trading as such. Also during this period, a series of floods caused by typhoons motivated the municipal government 
     to construct a tall levee along the riverfront, with the result that the embankment now stands some 10 metres higher than street 
     level. The Bunds revitalization began in 1986 with a new promenade by the Dutch Architect Paulus Snoeren and has dramatically changed 
     the streetscape of the Bund. In the 1990s, Zhongshan Road (named after Sun Yat-sen), the road on which the Bund is centred, was widened 
     to ten lanes. As a result, most of the parkland which had existed along the road disappeared. Also in this period, the ferry wharves 
     connecting the Bund and Pudong, which had served the area's original purpose, were removed. A number of pleasure cruises still operate 
     from some nearby wharves.

        <br>
        In the 1990s, the Shanghai government attempted to promote an extended concept of the Bund to boost tourism, and land value in nearby 
     areas, as well as to reconcile the promotion of "colonial relics" with the Socialist ideology. In its expanded form, the term "Bund" 
     (as "New Bund" or "Northern Bund") was used to refer to areas south of the Yan'an Road, and a stretch of riverfront north of the Suzhou River 
     (Zhabei). Such use of the term, however, remains rare outside of tourism literature.
        <br>
        From 2008, a major reconfiguration of traffic flow along the Bund was carried out. The first stage of the plan involved the southern 
     end of the Bund, and saw the demolition of a section of the Yan'an Road elevated expressway, including removal of the large elevated expressway 
     exit structure that formerly dominated the confluence of Yan'an Road and the Bund. A second phase involved the year-long restoration of the 
     century-old Waibaidu Bridge at the northern end of the Bund. In a third stage, the former 10-lane Bund roadway was reconstructed in two levels, 
     with six lanes carried in a new tunnel. The vacated road space was used to widen the landscaped promenade along the waterfront. The new 
     concrete bridge that was built in 1991 to relieve traffic on Waibaidu Bridge was rendered obsolete by the new double-levelled roadway, and 
     demolished.

        <br>
        The Bund was reopened to the public on Sunday 28 March 2010 after restoration for the 2010 Expo.
        <br>
        A stampede occurred on December 31, 2014, at 11:36 p.m. in the waterfront. At least 36 people were killed and 47 injured in the incident. The 
     primary incident took place near Chen Yi Square, where a large crowd, estimated at around 300,000, had gathered for the new year celebration.
        <br>
        The bund is one of the most prominent features when viewed from the Shanghai World Financial Center in Pudong and its observation deck on the 100th 
     floor.
